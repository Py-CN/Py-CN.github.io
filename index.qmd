### About PyCN

Cluj-Napoca has earned a reputation as a dynamic hub for technology and innovation, often dubbed the "Silicon Valley of Eastern Europe." With its thriving startup culture and continuous advancements in the tech sector, the city is making significant strides in Web and mobile application development. But beyond these strengths, Cluj-Napoca also boasts a growing and vibrant community of Python enthusiasts, data engineers, and data scientists.

PyCN (Python Community of Cluj-Napoca) is at the heart of this movement, serving as a platform for Python developers of all skill levels to come together, learn, and share knowledge. This website provides an overview of our meetup activities, events, and the resources that help support the Python ecosystem here in Cluj-Napoca.

We invite you to join us in building a strong, supportive, and innovative Python community. Whether you’re a curious beginner or an experienced developer, your presence and contribution can help shape the future of Python development in Cluj-Napoca.

PyCN is a welcoming meetup community designed for anyone with an interest in Python, Machine Learning, Data Science, and AI — **regardless of experience level**. From complete beginners taking their first steps in programming to seasoned professionals seeking to expand their knowledge, we aim to provide a space where everyone can learn, grow, and connect.

Our goal is to cover a wide range of topics to cater to the diverse interests of our members.
