    "text": "About PyCN\nCluj-Napoca has earned a reputation as a dynamic hub for technology and innovation, often dubbed the “Silicon Valley of Eastern Europe.” With its thriving startup culture and continuous advancements in the tech sector, the city is making significant strides in Web and mobile application development. But beyond these strengths, Cluj-Napoca also boasts a growing and vibrant community of Python enthusiasts, data engineers, and data scientists.\nPyCN (Python Community of Cluj-Napoca) is at the heart of this movement, serving as a platform for Python developers of all skill levels to come together, learn, and share knowledge. This website provides an overview of our meetup activities, events, and the resources that help support the Python ecosystem here in Cluj-Napoca.\nWe invite you to join us in building a strong, supportive, and innovative Python community. Whether you’re a curious beginner or an experienced developer, your presence and contribution can help shape the future of Python development in Cluj-Napoca.\n\n\nOur Audience\nPyCN is a welcoming meetup community designed for anyone with an interest in Python, Machine Learning, Data Science, and AI — regardless of experience level. From complete beginners taking their first steps in programming to seasoned professionals seeking to expand their knowledge, we aim to provide a space where everyone can learn, grow, and connect.\nOur goal is to cover a wide range of topics to cater to the diverse interests of our members. From professional development tools and interacting with physical devices to innovative data analytics, personal projects, educational initiatives, and even creative coding, there’s something for everyone. We believe that coding is not just a technical skill but also a way to express creativity and have fun.\n\n\nBecome a Speaker\nAre you passionate about Python or have a topic you’d love to share with the community? We’re always looking for speakers to present at our PyCN events! Whether you want to showcase a project, share your insights, or inspire others with your experiences, we’d love to hear from you.\nPlease submit your talk proposal using this form, and let’s make the next meetup even more engaging and informative. We’re committed to keeping our meetups open, inclusive, and community-driven, so don’t hesitate to reach out with your ideas or suggest new topics and collaborative opportunities.\n\nWhen and Where\n\nWhen: Our meetups take place monthly throughout the year, providing regular opportunities to learn, network, and collaborate.\n\nWhere: We like to keep things fresh by rotating our meetup locations across Cluj-Napoca, so each event brings a new experience and a chance to explore different venues in the city.\n\n\n\n\nStay Connected\nTo stay up-to-date with all the latest from PyCN, including upcoming meetups, workshops, and events, follow us on our Meetup page.\nFor any questions, suggestions, or if you’d like to get involved in organizing or sponsoring our events, feel free to reach out via email at admin@pycn.fyi.

    "text": "Why Sponsoring?\nBesides the organisers, supporters and speakers, our sponsors are an ESSENTIAL part of keeping this going. They provide food and drinks, but more importantly, they provide the venue and cover travel for visiting speakers.\nOur experience shows that this form of sponsorship can be very effective to reach your target audience whether you are looking for developers to fill an open position or you would just like to introduce your organisation or product to developers.\nBy supporting our community you enable us to provide a forum for discussion and exchange that does not come with an exclusive price tag, but is open for a broader group of participants that share a common interest.\n\n\nWhat do you get?\nIn return for your contribution, we offer you the following:\n- 5-minute presentation on stage at the beginning of the event.\n- Your organization would be mentioned on the event page with a logo and text and promoted to our community.\n- We will include you in 3 announcement emails that go out to members of PyCN.\n- The satisfaction of knowing you are contributing to the amazing developer community.\nWe accept 2 sponsors per event. You are welcome to bring flyers, stickers and other promo materials and put them on tables or chairs, banners only after consultation.\n\n\nLong-term sponsoring\nWe also offer yearly sponsoring and promotion packages – all non-profit. Please contact our organisers for details.\n\n\nFree Conference Promotions\nWe like to promote conferences that are relevant to our visitors. Having a discount code tailored for our meetup is even better. Offering a ticket or two to raffle during the meetup is a great addition!\nWe love to keep our audience up to date with current events. To avoid spamming our community, our team has decided the following:\nSince we can’t attend all these conferences, it’s hard for us to determine which ones are good.\n\nWe will ONLY accept conference promotion in exchange for free tickets if a well-known community member endorses the conference to a PyCN organizer.\n\nWe also promote free events in Romania that are relevant to our community.\n\nWith this step, we hope to act in the best interest of our community.\n\nPaid Conference Promotion\nWe offer paid promotion for conferences following our standard sponsorship guidelines.\n\n\n\nOrganizer Team\nPyCN uses sponsoring money to pay for venue, free drinks and free food. 100% of the organizers work is free and unpaid."
